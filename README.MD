# A Simple Implementation of Point Linking Network

## Introduction

**I've update the code to support both Python2 and Python3, PyTorch 0.4.**

This project is a **Simplified** Point Linking Network implementation based on [chainercv](https://github.com/chainer/chainercv) and other [projects](#acknowledgement) . It aims to:

- Simplify the code (*Simple is better than complex*)
- Make the code more straightforward (*Flat is better than nested*)
- Match the performance reported in [origin paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03646) 
- [my note](https://yangyanggirl.github.io/2019/06/13/Point-Linking-Network-for-Object-Detection%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/)(*Speed Counts and mAP Matters*)
